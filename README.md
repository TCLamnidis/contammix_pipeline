# ContamMix pipeline

This is a simple nextflow pipeline to run [ContamMix](https://github.com/plfjohnson/contamMix). 
Currently this pipeline relies on a container and assets that are available on the MPI-EVA computational servers, and are hard-coded. 
It is therefore not portable, but will be updated in the future to make it properly portable.

For now it serves as a simple nextflow pipeline example.
